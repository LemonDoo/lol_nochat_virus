# lol_nochat_virus
The most overkill enter-disabling script in existence.
Release setup made with WinRar cause lazy.
Enjoy.

Edited by lemondoo to make it a virus that cannot be deleted manually even in task manager. Have to system restart in order for program to stop running, and if put in startup programs, cannot even do that :)


# Installation

METHOD 1:

Put the LolPacifier-Extract.exe file in a folder and run it, it will extract the files into a folder.

METHOD 2 (IF ANTIVIRUS RETARDED):

Download the portable.zip and extract it in a folder.


# Notes

Probably will update this so script runs on system startup ... the goal is to make it impossible to remove whatsoever :)
